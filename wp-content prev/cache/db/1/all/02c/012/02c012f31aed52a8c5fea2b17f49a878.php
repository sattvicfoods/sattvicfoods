<h4>Our Steel-cut Oats contain a high amount of Beta Glucans</h4>
Beta glucan is known to lower bad cholesterol and triglycerides. By eating oats daily one can see a reduction in bad cholesterol (LDL) levels between 5-7 percent. Beta glucan, being a soluble fibre, slows down food transit in the body, thus slowing down digestion. ThisÂ means the body doesn't absorb sugarÂ and keepsÂ blood sugar levels regulated. Beta glucan, being indigestible, goes through the whole digestive tract taking cholesterol out with it thus helping lower cholesterol levels.
<div class="text_exposed_show">This increased metabolism and lowered blood sugar response by including beta glucans in your diet mean it can also help you lose weight!!</div>

<h4>Our Oat Groats contain a high amount of Beta Glucans</h4>
Beta glucan is known to lower bad cholesterol and triglycerides. By eating oats daily one can see a reduction in bad cholesterol (LDL) levels between 5-7 percent.

Beta glucan, being a soluble fibre, slows down food transit in the body, thus slowing down digestion. ThisÂ means the body doesn't absorb sugarÂ and keepsÂ blood sugar levels regulated. Beta glucan, being indigestible, goes through the whole digestive tract taking cholesterol out with it thus helping lower cholesterol levels.
<div class="text_exposed_show">

This increased metabolism and lowered blood sugar response by including beta glucans in your diet mean it can also help you lose weight!!
