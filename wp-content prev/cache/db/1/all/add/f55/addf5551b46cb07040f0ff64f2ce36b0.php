<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It¬†contains many elements that products of animal origin do not possess. It is more rich in proteins than any animal source.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Human consumption of bee pollen is even praised in the Bible, ancient Chinese and Egyptian texts.</span></p>

Consumed as a dietary supplement for its high soluble-fiber content, acacia powder can be taken in capsule or tablet form, or as a loose powder. It can help increase your fiber intake, and it may also contribute to the loss of body fat.</p>

<section class="article-section">
<h2 class="header"><span data-dmc="section-headline">Increases Fiber Intake</span></h2>
<p data-dmc="section">Acacia powder is a good source of insoluble fiber, and it is commonly taken to increase fiber consumption and help alleviate constipation. A 1-tablespoon serving of the powder has 6 grams of fiber, which provides between 21 and 29 percent of the recommended dietary allowance, of fiber for adult women, and between 16 and 20 percent for men. Acacia powder can help you get your daily recommended amount of fiber. A diet high in fiber is associated with lower blood cholesterol and a decreased risk of heart disease.</p>

<p data-dmc="section">Acacia powder can be consumed on its own as a supplement. It is important to consume the powder ‚Äî as much as 1 tablespoon ‚Äî with at least 8 ounces of fluids, such as water or juice.

Acacia powder¬†is a soluble fiber with proven prebiotic effects. Studies have shown that soluble fiber, as part of the diet, regulates bowel motility (alleviating both diarrhea and constipation), and relieves abdominal pain from IBS.
