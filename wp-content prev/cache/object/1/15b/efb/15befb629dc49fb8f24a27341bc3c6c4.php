Maca has been used for centuries by indigenous Andean communities as a source of healing and sustenance, but only recently has it begun to gain popularity in Western diets. It is an herbaceous plant native to the Andean mountains of Peru and Bolivia and it‚Äôs one of the only known edible plants in the world to grow at such high altitudes.

As an adaptogenic food, maca helps our bodies cope with stress by balancing our delicate endoc<span class="text_exposed_show">rine system, and is said to help with fertility issues and hormonal imbalances. Evidence has been found that maca cultivation goes as far back as 1600 B.C. and it remains a staple in the diet of the Quechua Indians of Peru.</span>

Besides balancing our hormones, maca is choc full of essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals including B, B1, and B2, as well as iron, magnesium, selenium, and calcium. It‚Äôs also a good source of fiber and plant protein, which makes it an ideal addition to smoothies for those looking for a plant-based protein boost. Maca is prized for it‚Äôs ability to give strength and increase endurance, and the alkaloids found in maca (called Macainas) assist in endocrine balance.

Maca mixes well with sweeter breakfasts, like porridge, oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies, and granola, and is a great addition to desserts. You can also mix a teaspoon or two into your coffee or tea.
