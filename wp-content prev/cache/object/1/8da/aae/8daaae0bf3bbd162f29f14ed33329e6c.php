Our Himalayan Salt CrystalsÂ areÂ sourced from the Khewra salt mine in Pakistan, the only legal source of this product since the salt mines in Himachal were shut in 2009. This salt is hand mined and no explosives are used to blast the salt chamber.
<h2><b>About</b></h2>
Once upon a time (a couple of hundreds of millions of years ago) crystallized sea salt beds, now deep within the Himalayan ranges, were covered by lava. Aside from being kept in a pristine environment that has been surrounded by snow and ice year round, the lava is thought to have protected the salt from modern-day pollution leading to the belief that salt from our Himalayas is the purest salt to be found on earth. It is now hand-mined from the mountains and brought to the market to be sold as the most premium salt in the world.

These salt deposits are roughly 250 million years old, meaning they were deposited long before the earth became polluted with heavy metals, pesticides and other chemicals. While there is really no such thing as "organic" salt, this is probably the most pristine salt you'll find anywhere on the planet

While pink salt is made up primarily of sodium, it also contains 60 to 65 trace minerals.
<h2><b>Using in Brine Therapy</b></h2>
Because of its mineral content, Himalayan salt can also be used in brine therapy, where it can help regulate your blood circulation and pressure, as well as treat skin diseases and help restore your acid-base balance. To take part in brine therapy, soak in a bath of dissolved Himalayan salt, which helps promote self-healing and detoxification through osmosis.

Best of all, Himalayan salt is naturally anti-microbial, so clean up requires just a quick scrub or rinse.
