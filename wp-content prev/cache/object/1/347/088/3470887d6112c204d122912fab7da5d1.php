The use of cacao for health dates back at least 3,000 years. The process of manufacturing dark chocolate retains epicatechin. Both epidemiological and clinical studies suggest a beneficial effect of dark chocolate on blood pressure, lipids and inflammation. Proposed mechanisms underlying these benefits include enhancedÂ nitric oxide bioavailability and improved mitochondrial structure and function.

<h3>Health Benefits</h3>
To get these benefits, the cacao needs to be pure. One of the purest forms is in the beans themselves because they have the least processing, and includesÂ cacao nibs.Â Cacao nibs are cacao beans that have been roasted, separated from their husks and broken into smaller pieces. Their health benefits include

Maintain muscle and nerve function

Helps lose weight

Prevent anemia

Reduce risk of heart disease and stroke

Treat diarrhea

Enhance mood
