Kokum is indigenous to the Western Ghats of India, and has been a part of the countryâ€™s history for centuries. The fruitâ€™s recognition is still limited to the subcontinent of Southeast Asia.
<h2>Source of our Kokum</h2>
Our Kokum grows in the wild in Kudal, Sindhudurg. Where only the best fruit are harvested and dried. Traditionally Kokum is dried with salt or a preservative, however we have convinced our farmers to give us a pure kokum free of additives.
<h2><strong>Taste</strong></h2>
Kokum is sweet, but acidic. It has a juicy texture common among other fruits in the mangosteen family: each of the fruitâ€™s five to eight sections has edible, watery yet potent flesh surrounding a malleable flat seed.

Dried kokum peel tastes exceptionally sour and metallic, with no trace of sweetness. The lack of sugar gives the fruit a salty disposition, not unlike fresh cranberry.

The fruit is seldom consumed raw and is instead used as a flavoring agent in curries or drinks.
