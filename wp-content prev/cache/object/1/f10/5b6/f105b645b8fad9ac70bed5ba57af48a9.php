Oats as we know them today originate from the wild red oat, a plant with origins in Asia. Originally cultivated for medicinal purposes, Oats have now become a food staple due to their numerous health benefits.

We import whole grain Oats from Western Australia which is one of the highest quality producers of this healthy grain. These Oats are thenÂ washed, hulled and dried in India and further processed at our facilities.
