A popular grain and staple in Eastern Europe but grows wildly in our Himalayas. Our Buckwheat isÂ farmed at altitudes as high as 4,400 meters and the period between sowing to harvest is only 30 days.Â Buckwheat grows so fast it crowds out most weeds. Hence no pesticides or fertilizers are needed to grow this crop and it is by default organic.
<h3>About ourÂ Buckwheat</h3>
TheyÂ are gluten free seeds from a plant related to rhubarb. The outer husk is pulled away and the grain-like fruit is harvested and eaten.
