Our PinkÂ salt is sourced from the Khewra salt mine in Pakistan, the only legal source of this product since the salt mines in Himachal were shut in 2009. This salt is hand mined and no explosives are used to blast the salt chamber.
<h2>About</h2>
Once upon a time (a couple of hundreds of millions of years ago) crystallized sea salt beds, now deep within the HimalayanÂ ranges, were covered by lava. Aside from being kept in a pristine environment that has been surrounded by snow and ice year round, the lava is thought to have protected the salt from modern-day pollution leading to the belief that salt from our Himalayas is the purest salt to be found on earth. It is now hand-mined from the mountains and brought to the culinary market to be sold as the most premium salt in the world.

These salt deposits are roughly 250 million years old, meaning they were deposited long before the earth became polluted with heavy metals, pesticides and other chemicals. While there is really no such thing as "organic" salt, this is probably the most pristine salt you'll find anywhere on the planet. Eating this salt is a lot like going back in time and consuming minerals from pre-industrial Earth.

The large crystals are cut up, rinsed with water, sun-dried and then ground into a powder.Â Our salt is always <b>stone ground</b>. No metal ever touches the salt during grinding. All the salt is extracted by hand from the salt caves (ancient sea bed deposits). No salt from other sources is mixed with this salt.
<h2><strong>Pink when crystals, whitish when powdered</strong></h2>
The light pink color of the ShivalikÂ Salt crystal is due to the presence of Natural Iron Oxide in the salt, when these crystalÂ salts are crushed, the powdered salt is more whitish than pink.
<h2><strong><span data-dmc="section-headline">Sodium and 84 Other Minerals</span></strong></h2>
<p data-dmc="section">While pinkÂ salt is made up primarily of sodium, it also contains 60 to 65 trace minerals. Sodium helps keep your blood pressure in check as well as aiding in cardiovascular function. The recommended upper limit is 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day for adults or as specified by your doctor in case of heart condition.</p>
PinkÂ Salt is a pristine source of natural mineral salts. It is good source of at least 10 essential minerals required by the human body, which is not present in the sea salt. ShivalikÂ salt has high quantities of phosphorus, calcium, potassium, iron, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, bromine, zirconium and iodine.
<h2><strong>Using in Cooking and Seasoning</strong></h2>
<p data-dmc="section">ShivalikÂ salt is an alternative to table salt. The crystals of the salt are best added to soups, stews or marinades, where they are easily dissolved.</p>

<h2 class="header"><strong><span data-dmc="section-headline">Using in Brine Therapy</span></strong></h2>
<p data-dmc="section">Because of its mineral content, ShivalikÂ salt can also be used in brine therapy, where it can help regulate your blood circulation and pressure, as well as treat skin diseases and help restore your acid-base balance. To take part in brine therapy, soak in a bath of dissolved ShivalikÂ salt, which helps promote self-healing and detoxification through osmosis.</p>
<p data-dmc="section">Best of all, ShivalikÂ salt is naturally anti-microbial, so clean up requires just a quick scrub or rinse.</p>

<h2><strong>Suitable for Fasting</strong></h2>
<p data-dmc="section">This salt can be even used during fast days, as many religions treat crystalÂ salt as pure as water and air since it is derived from nature.</p>
