Consumed as a dietary supplement for its high soluble-fiber content, acacia powder can be taken in capsule or tablet form, or as a loose powder. It can help increase your fiber intake, and it may also contribute to the loss of body fat.</p>

<h2 class="header"><span data-dmc="section-headline">Increases Fiber Intake</span></h2>
<p data-dmc="section">Acacia powder is a good source of insoluble fiber, and it is commonly taken to increase fiber consumption and help alleviate constipation. A 1-tablespoon serving of the powder has 6 grams of fiber, which provides between 21 and 29 percent of the recommended dietary allowance, of fiber for adult women, and between 16 and 20 percent for men. Acacia powder can help you get your daily recommended amount of fiber. A diet high in fiber is associated with lower blood cholesterol and a decreased risk of heart disease.</p>

<h2 class="header"><span data-dmc="section-headline">Using AcaciaÂ Fiber</span></h2>
<p data-dmc="section">Acacia powder can be consumed on its own as a supplement. It is important to consume the powder â€” as much as 1 tablespoon â€” with at least 8 ounces of fluids, such as water or juice. Because it is high in fiber, you need to make sure that you drink enough water throughout the day to reduce the risk of constipation.</p>

</section>Through dietary management, Acacia senegal helps relieve IBS symptoms, including diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain.

Acacia powderÂ is a soluble fiber with proven prebiotic effects. Studies have shown that soluble fiber, as part of the diet, regulates bowel motility (alleviating both diarrhea and constipation), and relieves abdominal pain from IBS. Acacia senegal's prebiotic effect stimulates the growth of healthy gut flora, which in turn reduces bloating, gas, and bowel irregularities from the digestive dysfunction of IBS.

AcaciaÂ Fiber has no IBS triggers:
<ul>
 	<li>No insoluble fiber</li>
 	<li>No acids</li>
 	<li>No gluten</li>
 	<li>No artificial sweeteners or ingredients</li>
 	<li>No GI stimulants or irritants</li>
</ul>
