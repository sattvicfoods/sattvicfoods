Primitive Man, like modern man, had no time for set meals.Â He was always on the run; looking for food, shelter orÂ protection.

Surviving on natureâ€™s gifts and relying on them for their nutrition. Berries, nuts, seeds, grains and honey were the powerhouses of nutrition before man started engineering food.
