According to Ayurveda &amp; Yoga, there are 3 basic gunas or qualities Sattva, Rajas and Tamas and the diets containing these foods are accordingly names Sattvic, Rajasic and Tamasic.

Foods that are strong in the Sattva element, lead to clarity and equanimity of mind while also being beneficial to the body. This is the basic principle behind Sattvic Foods, to provide you a convenient way to consume foods that have a net positive impact on your health and pranic energy.

Rajasic and Tamasic Foods have little or no benefit to the body and can include products like fast foods, meats, soft drinks, etc.

<strong>Why aren't you Organic?Â </strong>

Not everything that is Organic is Healthy and not everything that is Healthy has to be Organic. It is true that the term Organic is associated with high quality, but nowadays the term Organic is used very loosely.

To be Organic requires certification and proof at all levels of handling. Right from proof that environmentally and animal friendly methods were used on the farm, followed by handling, packaging and transportation all in an Organic way. All this is just before the food production begins.

The requirement and cost to obtain Organic certification drives up the cost of the end products significantly for the end consumer, may be 2-3 times of what we sell our products for right now.

Rest assured you must know that we challenge ourselves everyday to source the best quality of ingredients from all over theÂ country. A lot of our products are made from organic ingredients. And some even from wild/jungle sourced ingredients which areÂ more beneficial than organic.

Our products are always free from Preservatives, Artificial Flavours and Harmful Chemicals.

<strong>What kind of Quality checks do we perform on our products?</strong>

We have a very stringent selection process and consult several experts on quality, authenticity and flavour before bringing a product to market. All our ingredients are measured against international standards and compared with supplies from USA, Europe, etc.

Each ingredient is individually tested for quality and flavour. The final product is then lab test our products for shelf life, nutritional information and gluten content. All our products are sent for trials and need to be approved by a majority of testers before they hit the market.
