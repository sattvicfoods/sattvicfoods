Epsom salts dissolved in warm water â€“ like those in an Epsom salt bath â€“ are easily absorbed through the skin where they immediately go to work inside our bodies. Magnesium also plays a critical role in the production of energy in cells, helping us to feel invigorated without causing feelings of restlessness or anxiety.

Epsom salts absorbed through the skin also work to relieve muscle tension, pain, and inflammation in joints.

Itâ€™s pretty common knowledge that soaking your feet in Epsom salts is good for soothing away aches and pains. But did you know that it can also help to treat athleteâ€™s foot and toenail fungal infections?
