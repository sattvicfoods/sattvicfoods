Our Carob PowderÂ originatesÂ from the idyllic lands of Madagascar.

Naturally Sweet, it is derived fromÂ the pod (that contains a luscious, edible pulp) of a carob tree.Â Once dried and roasted, the pulp is ground into a powder!
<h4><strong>AboutÂ our Carob Powder</strong></h4>
The carob bean is anÂ extremely versatile superfood, possessing a sweet nutty cocoa flavour and isÂ  rich in soluble fibre.

Our carob powder can therefore be used as a healthy alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners. Its chocolate-like taste means that it can replace cocoa or chocolate.
<h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
Carob Powder
<h4><strong>Why buy our Carob Powder</strong>?</h4>
Free fromÂ caffeine or theobromine our carob powder is ideal for people sensitive to the effects of caffeine or who want to avoid caffeine.

It is lower in fat than cocoa and boasts 3 times more calcium too. Simply, substitute it for recipes that call for Cocoa or Chocolate. It is similar to cocoa powder in colour, yet has aÂ characteristic special flavour and texture of its own.

For all the pet fanatics out there, carobÂ is a pet friendly substitute to chocolate. Surprise them on the days they made you feel how special you are, with some carob treats made just for them!
<h4><strong>How to useÂ Carob Powder</strong></h4>
It has a sweet and mild taste as compared to the bitterness of Cocoa. You could replace cocoa powder with carob powder one-for-one in your recipesÂ but reduce the amount of sugar or sweeteners in the recipe by about 25%. Alternatively, you could use half cocoa powder and half carob powder.

Try using itÂ to add a delicious extra dimension to your favourite smoothies, nut milks,Â protein shakesÂ or to prepare a tempting range of raw food snacks and desserts, including raw chocolate, cakes and cookies.
