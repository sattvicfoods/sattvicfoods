<ol>
 	<li>You select the Butter of your choice as a base. It will be 70% of the ingredient base of your product if an emulsifier is not selected.</li>
 	<li>Select the carrier oil of your choice this would be the approximately 30% of the product.</li>
 	<li>If you want a creamy butter you should select No for Emulsifier. If you want your blend to have the consistency of a Salve, you would select to use an Emulsifier. Or if you stay in a warm place and would prefer it to stay consistent at room temperature.</li>
 	<li>Select the flavour of your choice. Since these are pure essential oils only about 10 drops are needed per 30g of product.</li>
