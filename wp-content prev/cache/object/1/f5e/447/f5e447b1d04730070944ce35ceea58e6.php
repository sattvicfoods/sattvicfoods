Rye has gained worldwide popularity due to its distinctive flavour. Its ability to withstand cold weather conditions better than other grains has ensured that it remains a staple in Eastern European countries and Scandinavia.

Rye is rich in dietary fibre and iron. It is a nutritious source of antioxidants and nutrients. Rye is not gluten-free but contains lesser gluten than wheat.
