Protein is a key element in any athlete's or training enthusiast's diet, but its also less popularly known for its ability to control hunger and promote weight loss. Put simply, protein is essential for growth and repair of all cells, including muscle cells, and it is therefore necessary in order to experience training adaptations.

Whey protein in particular contains an incredible range of essential amino acids. These are absorbed quickly and help you increase strength, gain muscle and lose significant amounts of body fat according to several studies.
