Mango Butter is the fat that is naturally present in the seeds of the Mango fruit (Mangifera Indica). Mango is indigenous to the Western Ghats of India, and has been a part of India's history for centuries. Ours is sourced from Independent Farming Cooperatives in the Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra which is world famous for its mango plantations.

Mango trees grow wild in Sindhudurg and have not yet come into contact with chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
