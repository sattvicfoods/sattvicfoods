It is used in the treatment ofÂ acne, sunburn and chapped skin. Itâ€™s encourages hair growth by unclogging follicles and soothing the skin.

It can act as a natural skin conditioner. It has nearly replaced animal fats in the manufacture of skin lotions and creams.

<h3>How to use</h3>
Skin moisturiser :Â You can rub a few drops of Jojoba oil between your palms and apply it on the face and other exposed parts whenever you venture out and after washing your face every time. For a deeper moisturizing effect, warm up a spoonful of Jojoba oil and massage it in after washing the face at bedtime and leave it on overnight. Pure Jojoba oil is fully absorbed into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and smooth.

To control oily skin : If youâ€™re troubled by oily scalp or trying hard to mask your shiny forehead and nose under layers of makeup, rubbing in Jojoba oil on the affected parts will give wonderful results.
