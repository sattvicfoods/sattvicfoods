While we understand that most consumers in India use Cash on Delivery. This is a very risky offering for any small business.

We practice the â€˜No cash on deliveryâ€™ policy in order to ensure that each item, in every order, is stored and shipped at optimum conditions. Per statistics and our own experience, a large percentage of orders on COD basis are sent back on some pretext or another. This results in unnecessary costs,Â wasted shipping fee and most importantlyÂ products moving out of the warehouse only to be sent back in a few days.

<strong>We prefer to keep our products Â for genuine buyers and guaranteed sales only.</strong>

We would like to share with you our passion for genuineÂ superfoodsÂ of incomparable quality and taste. For severalÂ Â years we have scouted the India and the globe for this fine selection of superfoods. Our goal isÂ Â to offer products that meet our â€” and your â€” uncompromising standards. Our commitment to you is to continue this quest for excellence.

But our commitment is to serving you as a customer and your complete satisfaction. We do make exceptions for genuine cases only. So if you have a REAL reason why you need COD or any other payment option, feel free to reach out to us.
