Our Coconut flour is purely made from the best coconuts without any additives, and is completely gluten free. We use the best coconuts from the coastal regions of Tamil Nadu that are organically certified.

Coconuts are carefully selected and skinned

Skinned coconuts are washed and then blended with water to remove the milk

The strained Coconut is then hung dried and dehydrated

It is then ground in a gluten free mill to produce flour, filled with the goodness of the superfood coconut.
<h4><strong>Why our Coconut Flour?</strong></h4>
