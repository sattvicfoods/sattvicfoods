Hulled Oat Groats are aÂ favourite breakfast cereal and the perfect way to start your day.

"Groat" is an old Scottish word that refers to cereal made from hulledÂ oats.

Though it does take a little longer to prepare than cut or rolled oats, the exceptional hearty flavour and chewy nature of the resulting porridge definitely make it well worth the effort.
<h3>Source of our Oats</h3>
Oats, as we know them today, originate from the wild red oat, a plant which has origins in Asia. Oats were originally cultivated for medicinal purposes but have now become a food staple due to their numerous health benefits.

We import whole grain Oats from Western Australia which is one of the highest quality producers of this healthy grain. These Oats are thenÂ washed, hulled and dried in India and further processed at our facilities.
<h3>About ourÂ Oat Groats</h3>
OurÂ selectionÂ process helps ensure that only the best quality oats are selected to progress to the cleaning and cutting process. This minimal processing retains all of the nutrients that people look for in their oats.

Oats are a rich source of fibre, protein and magnesium. Not only are you able to eat them as oatmeal but they add health benefits to breads, bakesÂ and protein shakes. All of that simply makes our oats a cut above the rest.

<h4>Our Oat Groats contain a high amount of Beta Glucans</h4>
Beta glucan is known to lower bad cholesterol and triglycerides. By eating oats daily one can see a reduction in bad cholesterol (LDL) levels between 5-7 percent.

Beta glucan, being a soluble fibre, slows down food transit in the body, thus slowing down digestion. ThisÂ means the body doesn't absorb sugarÂ and keepsÂ blood sugar levels regulated. Beta glucan, being indigestible, goes through the whole digestive tract taking cholesterol out with it thus helping lower cholesterol levels.

This increased metabolism and lowered blood sugar response by including beta glucans in your diet mean it can also help you lose weight!!
