Steel CutÂ Oats are aÂ favourite breakfast cereal and the perfect way to start your day. Also called Scottish Oats or Irish Oats are groats (whole oat kernels) cut into two or three pieces. The difference between rolled and steel cut oats is that steel cut leaves the endosperm intact, making them healthier than rolled.
<h3>Source of our Steel cut Oats</h3>
Oats, as we know them today, originate from the wild red oat, a plant which has origins in Asia. Oats were originally cultivated for medicinal purposes but have now become a food staple due to their numerous health benefits. We import whole grain Oats from Western Australia which is one of the highest quality producers of this healthy grain. These Oats are thenÂ washed, hulled and dried in India and further processed at our facilities.

<h4>Our Steel-cut Oats contain a high amount of Beta Glucans</h4>
Beta glucan is known to lower bad cholesterol and triglycerides. By eating oats daily one can see a reduction in bad cholesterol (LDL) levels between 5-7 percent. Beta glucan, being a soluble fibre, slows down food transit in the body, thus slowing down digestion. ThisÂ means the body doesn't absorb sugarÂ and keepsÂ blood sugar levels regulated. Beta glucan, being indigestible, goes through the whole digestive tract taking cholesterol out with it thus helping lower cholesterol levels.
<div class="text_exposed_show">This increased metabolism and lowered blood sugar response by including beta glucans in your diet mean it can also help you lose weight!!</div>
