Buckwheat has a great flavour that suits bread baking and can be substituted in many recipes where regular flour is used.
<h3>Source of our Buckwheat</h3>
A popular grain and staple in Eastern Europe but grows wildly in our Himalayas. Our Buckwheat is farmed at altitudes as high as 4,400 meters and the period between sowing to harvest is only 30 days. Buckwheat grows so fast it crowds out most weeds. Hence no pesticides or fertilizers are needed to grow this crop and it is by default organic.
<h3>About our Buckwheat</h3>
They are gluten free seeds from a plant related to rhubarb. The outer husk is pulled away and the grain-like fruit is harvested and eaten.

Naturally Gluten-free and full of Proteins and Fibre. Enjoy this nutrient rich superfood brought to you in a convenient way, peeled and ready to cook, soak or sprout.

First cultivated in Southeast Asia thousands of years ago, in time buckwheat journeyed west and took root in Eastern Europe, where it became the star of many classic dishes. They are very nutritious, and growing in popularity in many nations across the globe. They are a complete protein because they include all the essential amino acids.

<h4>Our Steel-cut Oats contain a high amount of Beta Glucans</h4>
Most importantly beta glucan can lower bad cholesterol and triglycerides. Eating oats with at least 3 g of beta glucan daily reduced bad cholesterol (LDL) levels between 5-7 percent.

Because it’s a soluble fiber, beta glucan slows down food transit in the intestines so that food takes longer for the body to digest.
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Slower digestion means the body doesn't absorb sugar as quickly, reducing the likelihood of blood sugar spikes and helping keep blood sugar levels regulated.

Because it is indigestible, it goes through the whole digestive tract and can take cholesterol out with it, helping lower cholesterol levels.

The increased metabolism and lowered blood sugar response by including beta glucans in your diet can also help you lose weight!!

Our Sun-dried Tomatoes in Olive Oil use ripe tomatoes that have spent a good deal of time basking in the blazing Goan sunshine. Post this process, the tomato fruits lose their moisture but maintain their nutritional value. During cooking, the natural levels of lycopene (an antioxidant) present in tomatoes rise. By sun drying them, the sun's natural heat does the same thing, and these Sun Dried Tomatoes now have 12 times the antioxidants as raw tomatoes!

Kokum is indigenous to the Western Ghats of India, and has been a part of the country’s history for centuries. The fruit’s recognition is still limited to the subcontinent of Southeast Asia, although a few kokum butter-based cosmetic products have begun to appear in the global markets.
<h2><strong>Taste</strong></h2>
Kokum is sweet, but acidic. It has a juicy texture common among other fruits in the mangosteen family: each of the fruit’s five to eight sections has edible, watery yet potent flesh surrounding a malleable flat seed.

Dried kokum peel tastes exceptionally sour and metallic, with no trace of sweetness. The lack of sugar gives the fruit a salty disposition, not unlike fresh cranberry.

The fruit is seldom consumed raw and is instead used as a flavoring agent in curries or drinks.
<h2><strong>Nutritional Value</strong></h2>
Kokum has not undergone a formal nutritional analysis. It is, however, high in vitamin C, low in fat and calories, low sugar and high in fiber.
<h2><strong>Health Benefits</strong></h2>
Kokum has many traditional medicinal uses:
<ul>
	<li>Anthelmintic</li>
	<li>Cardiotonic</li>
	<li>Fights dysentery</li>
	<li>Reduces tumors</li>
	<li>Alleviates pain</li>
	<li>Astringent</li>
	<li>Its juice aids digestion an wards off heat stroke</li>
	<li>Its butter treats burns and various wounds</li>
	<li>Reduces biliousness</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>How to use</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Substitute</strong> for tomato or tamarind to make a zestier dal or curry.</li>
	<li>Make<strong> rasam</strong> by soaking and boiling the peel in water. Use 1 cup of water for every 2 kokum peels. Add salt and sugar to the mixture once boiled. On the side, briefly heat mustard seeds, chili and cumin in oil. Add these spices to the kokum water concoction. Serve the rasam with rice or serve as a soup.</li>
	<li>Make <strong>kokum kadi,</strong> a famous sour, savory beverage made by combining dried coconut, salt and green chilies with kokum syrup and water.</li>
	<li>Make <strong>kokum tea</strong>, Bring water to boil in a medium pot, add kokum and let it simmer for a few minutes. Strain and serve hot.</li>

"","606","79552526254","Himalayan Crystal Salt (Stone Ground)","himalayan-crystal-salt","http://sattvicfoods.in/product/himalayan-crystal-salt/","http://sattvicfoods.in/product/himalayan-crystal-salt/","Once upon a time (a couple of hundreds of millions of years ago) crystallized sea salt beds, now deep within the Himalayans, were covered by lava. Aside from being kept it in a pristine environment that has been surrounded by snow and ice year round, the lava is thought to have protected the salt from modern-day pollution leading to the belief that Himalayan crystal salt is the purest salt to be found on earth. It is now hand-mined from the mountains and brought to the culinary market to be sold as the most premium salt in the world.

These salt deposits are roughly 250 million years old, meaning they were deposited long before the earth became polluted with heavy metals, pesticides and other chemicals. While there is really no such thing as ""organic"" salt, this is probably the most pristine salt you'll find anywhere on the planet. Eating this salt is a lot like going back in time and consuming minerals from pre-industrial Earth.

The large crystals are cut up, rinsed with water, sun-dried and then ground into a powder. Our salt is always <b>stone ground</b>. No metal ever touches the salt during grinding. All the salt is extracted by hand from the salt caves (ancient sea bed deposits). No salt from other sources is mixed with this salt.
<h2><strong>Pink when crystals, whitish when powdered</strong></h2>
The light pink color of the Crystal Salt crystal is due to the presence of Natural Iron Oxide in the salt, when these crystal salts are crushed, the powdered salt is more whitish than pink.
<h2><strong><span data-dmc=""section-headline"">Sodium and 84 Other Minerals</span></strong></h2>
<p data-dmc=""section"">While himalayan crystal salt is made up primarily of sodium, it also contains 60 to 65 trace minerals. Sodium helps keep your blood pressure in check as well as aiding in cardiovascular function. The recommended upper limit is 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day for adults or as specified by your doctor in case of heart condition.</p>
Himalayan Crystal Salt is a pristine source of natural mineral salts. It is good source of at least 10 essential minerals required by the human body, which is not present in the sea salt. Himalayan crystal salt has high quantities of phosphorus, calcium, potassium, iron, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, bromine, zirconium and iodine.
<h2><strong>Using in Cooking and Seasoning</strong></h2>
<p data-dmc=""section"">Himalayan salt is an alternative to table salt. The crystals of the salt are best added to soups, stews or marinades, where they are easily dissolved.</p>

<h2 class=""header""><strong><span data-dmc=""section-headline"">Using in Brine Therapy</span></strong></h2>
<p data-dmc=""section"">Because of its mineral content, Himalayan crystal salt can also be used in brine therapy, where it can help regulate your blood circulation and pressure, as well as treat skin diseases and help restore your acid-base balance. To take part in brine therapy, soak in a bath of dissolved Himalayan crystal salt, which helps promote self-healing and detoxification through osmosis.</p>
<p data-dmc=""section"">Best of all, Himalayan salt is naturally anti-microbial, so clean up requires just a quick scrub or rinse.</p>

<h2><strong>Suitable for Fasting</strong></h2>
<p data-dmc=""section"">This salt can be even used during fast days, as many religions treat crystal salt as pure as water and air since it is derived from nature.</p>

<h2><strong>Benefits of Consuming</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li data-dmc=""section"">Create an electrolyte balance</li>
	<li data-dmc=""section"">Increases hydration</li>
	<li data-dmc=""section"">Regulate water content both inside and outside of cells</li>

<h3><b>7 Kombucha Health Benefits</b></h3>

<hr />

<b>#1 Detoxification</b> – The detoxifying capacity of kombucha is immense. A perfect example has been observed in its ability to counteract liver cell toxicity.

<hr />

<b><img class=""alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-21374"" src=""http://draxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Digestive-System-232x224.jpg"" alt=""Digestive system"" width=""232"" height=""224"" />#2 </b><b>Digestion</b> – Naturally the antioxidant prowess of this ancient tea counteracts free radicals that create problems in the digestive system. However, the greatest reason kombucha supports digestion is because of its high levels of beneficial acid, <a href=""http://draxe.com/top-10-probiotics/"">probiotics</a> and enzymes.

Kombucha’s is able to prevent and heal <a href=""http://draxe.com/leaky-gut-syndrome-natural-cures/"">leaky gut</a> and stomach ulcers. No surprise to us, it was proven to be as effective as prescription drugs.

<hr />

<b>#3 Energy</b> – Kombucha’s ability to invigorate people has been credited to the formation of iron that is released from the black tea during the fermentation process.  It also contains some caffeine and b-vitamins, which can energize the body.

Through a special process known as <i>chelation</i>, the iron released helps to boost blood hemoglobin, improving oxygen supply to tissues and stimulating the energy producing process at the cellular level. In other words, by helping the body create more energy (ATP), the ancient tea can help those who regularly drink stay energized for extended periods of time.

<hr />

<b>#4 Immune Health</b> – Clinically proven to decrease oxidative stress and related immuno-suppression, a powerful antioxidant known as <i>D-saccharic acid-1, 4-lactone</i> (DSL) has been discovered during the kombucha fermentation process that is not found in black tea alone. Also, we know the probiotics found in kombucha support the immune system.

<hr />

<b><img class=""alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21373"" src=""http://draxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Healthy-Joints-e1418447672180-232x224.jpg"" alt=""Joint Health"" width=""232"" height=""224"" />#5 Joint Care</b> – Kombucha can help heal, repair and prevent <a href=""http://draxe.com/4-ways-to-naturally-reduce-joint-pain/"">joint damage</a> in a number of ways. Kombucha is loaded with glucosamines, which increase synovial hyaluronic acid production. This supports the preservation of collagen and prevents arthritic pain. In the same way it supports joint collagen it can also support collagen of the entire body and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.

<hr />

<b>#6 Cancer Prevention</b> – Kombucha has also been proven beneficial for <a href=""http://draxe.com/cancer-natural-remedies/"">cancer</a> prevention and recovery.  A study published in <i>Cancer Letters</i> found that by consuming glucaric acid found in kombucha reduced the risk of cancer in humans.

<b>#7 Weight Loss</b> – Data from a study in 2005 showed evidence that kombucha can improve metabolism and limit fat accumulation.

<h2>Caution</h2>
<strong>Women who are pregnant or nursing-</strong>

While kombucha hasn’t been studied much at all in pregnant women, there is always concern that pregnant women should not consume alcohol or caffeine, both of which are present in kombucha in small amounts. Before more formal research is conducted showing that it’s completely safe, pregnant women are advised to air on the safe side and avoid kombucha.

<strong>Those who cannot tolerate even low levels of sugar, caffeine or alcohol-</strong>

Kombucha is brewed using black sea and sugar, which when fermented turn into alcohol is very small amounts (only about 1% of kombucha is believed to be alcohol). For people with existing diabetes, kombucha likely won’t cause much of a problem considering it is very low in sugar (about 2 grams per 8 oz.) but it’s worth being careful about and monitoring blood sugar levels and related symptoms. For those with digestive problems like IBS or anxiety disorders, the low level of caffeine in kombucha is also something to be conscious of, since caffeine can sometimes aggravate these conditions.

They are a one of the best dietary sources of magnesium as well as a good source of calcium, iron, copper, zinc and potassium.</header><header class=""entry-header""></header><header class=""entry-header"">Cocoa nibs contain 272 milligrams of magnesium per 100 grams. Magnesium is an important mineral that many people are known to be deficient in. It cannot be produced by the body, and therefore, must be obtained through food sources or supplements. Cocoa nibs are a delicious way to meet the dietary requirements for this important nutrient.Studies show that cocoa nibs<strong> have higher antioxidant levels than blueberries, red wine and green tea</strong>. The antioxidants in cocoa nibs are also more stable than in other foods and are easy for the body to assimilate.<b>Health Benefits</b><strong>Energy Boost:</strong> Cocoa nibs contain a substance called theobromine, a central nervous system stimulant that has a similar, though less powerful, stimulating effect as caffeine. It may give you a healthy energy boost if you're feeling low during the day.

<strong>Mood Elevators:</strong> Cocoa contains tryptophan, an essential amino acid required for the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Enhanced serotonin levels can quell anxiety and enhance mood. Eating cocoa also helps to release endorphins, the body’s natural opiates. Endorphins are what give runners that natural high. Eating cocoa can have a similar effect and may explain why some people become self proclaimed chocoholics.

<strong>Appetite Control:</strong> Coco contains chromium an important mineral for stabilizing blood sugar and reducing appetite.

<strong>Improve Circulation:</strong> Cocoa is a great source of flavanols, powerful antioxidants that play an important role in circulation. Flavanols help to prevent clogged arteries by helping to stop fatty acids from oxidizing in the bloodstream. Flavanols also help make blood platelets less sticky, which reduces the risk of blood clots, heart attacks and strokes.

<strong>Improve Cholesterol Levels:</strong> Cocoa contains healthy monounsaturated fats. The same fats found in olive oil. These healthy fats have been shown to raise good cholesterol (HDL) levels.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Our Whey Protein is pure and natural, unlike hormone pumped mass market Supplements ours does not contain any thickeners or fillers, artificial flavours or preservatives. Our whey protein is un-denatured and has the highest biological value (BV) of any known protein. It is micro-filtered and not heat treated to produce an ultra pure protein. </span></p>

<h3>What is Whey Protein?</h3>
With over 19.5g of whey protein per 25g serving and delivering an outstanding amino acid profile, Whey Protein is the perfect protein supplement because there just aren't other proteins that compare with the amino acid profile and nutritional benefits. It also provides an unrivalled combination of taste, value and results.
<h3>Why should I take a protein supplement like this?</h3>
Protein is an fundamental element of any athlete or training enthusiasts nutritional protocol, but also less popularly known for its ability to control hunger and promote weight loss. Put simply protein is essential for growth and repair of all cells, including muscle cells, and it is therefore necessary in order to experience training adaptations. The vast majority of us will struggle to consume the amounts of protein required for positive training adaptations through whole foods alone.
<h3>How is this whey protein concentrate made?</h3>
This un-denatured whey protein powder sourced directly from leading dairies. Manufactured from vegetarian sweet cheese using a cross-flow micro-filtration process ensures that you receive only the most pure whey protein concentrate, packed with all 20 essential and non-essential amino acids. Processing is carried out at low temperatures to ensure that it is un-denatured and highly bioavailable.
<h3>What’s so special about whey protein anyway?</h3>
Whey protein is one of two types of proteins derived from cows’ milk, with the other being casein. It is absorbed faster than other forms of protein making it an excellent choice pre and post-workout and after fasted periods (the first meal of the day). Whey protein has the highest biological value (BV) of any dietary protein and appears to have a synergistic effect with high GI carbohydrates, such as maltodextrin or dextrose.
<h3>What flavour is this whey protein?</h3>
We understand that everyone’s different with unique needs, tastes and nutritional requirements. That’s why our Whey is unflavoured, leaving the choice entirely up to you.
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Since it is unflavoured, we recommend mixing it with our Rich Dark Cocoa Powder for a smooth flavour.</span></p>

Consumed as a dietary supplement for its high soluble-fiber content, acacia powder can be taken in capsule or tablet form, or as a loose powder. It can help increase your fiber intake, and it may also contribute to the loss of body fat.</p>

<section class=""article-section"">
<h2 class=""header""><span data-dmc=""section-headline"">Increases Fiber Intake</span></h2>
<p data-dmc=""section"">Acacia powder is a good source of insoluble fiber, and it is commonly taken to increase fiber consumption and help alleviate constipation. A 1-tablespoon serving of the powder has 6 grams of fiber, which provides between 21 and 29 percent of the recommended dietary allowance, of fiber for adult women, and between 16 and 20 percent for men. Acacia powder can help you get your daily recommended amount of fiber. A diet high in fiber is associated with lower blood cholesterol and a decreased risk of heart disease.</p>

<h2 class=""header""><span data-dmc=""section-headline"">Using Acacia Fiber</span></h2>
<p data-dmc=""section"">Acacia powder can be consumed on its own as a supplement. It is important to consume the powder — as much as 1 tablespoon — with at least 8 ounces of fluids, such as water or juice. Because it is high in fiber, you need to make sure that you drink enough water throughout the day to reduce the risk of constipation.</p>

</section>Through dietary management, Acacia senegal helps relieve IBS symptoms, including diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain.

Acacia powder is a soluble fiber with proven prebiotic effects. Studies have shown that soluble fiber, as part of the diet, regulates bowel motility (alleviating both diarrhea and constipation), and relieves abdominal pain from IBS. Acacia senegal's prebiotic effect stimulates the growth of healthy gut flora, which in turn reduces bloating, gas, and bowel irregularities from the digestive dysfunction of IBS.

Cissus quadrangularis is a traditional ayurvedic herb in use for more than one thousand years. Its nickname is “bone setter.”

Additional interest in cissus quadrangularis and metabolism centers around its historical use for hemorrhoids, ulcers, asthma, and constipation – all important issues associated with bacterial imbalance in the digestive tract.  Science supports the traditional use of cissus quadrangularis to help heal the lining of the digestive tract, reduce inflammation, enhance antioxidant defenses, and control bacterial imbalance. Cissus quadrangularis has previously been shown to have antibacterial properties, including against the Staphylococcus family typically found in excess in overweight people.

Another recent study showed cissus quadrangularis to be highly protective of the liver, offsetting the toxic effects of a TB drug by drastically reducing free radical damage. This is relevant to weight management, as the liver is often subject to inflammatory and free radical-producing insults coming from both the digestive tract and white adipose tissue. Thus, cissus quadrangularis helps offset metabolic stress associated with gut imbalance by a variety of mechanisms.

<strong>Taste and Uses of Beet Powder
</strong>Beet powder has a slightly sweet, earthy taste that can add a boost of nutrients to your recipes. Use a few teaspoons of the powder in sauces and salad dressings – one teaspoon of the powder is equivalent to one beet. Beet powder can also be used as an alternative food coloring in cakes and cupcakes to make them a bright red velvet color. Using cocoa in cake recipes will help subdue the beet’s natural earthy flavor.

<strong>Health Benefits</strong>

1. Can reduce stroke, heart attack and blood pressure:

Beetroots, being rich in nitrates can reduce stroke, heart related diseases and blood pressure. This is because nitrate gets oxidized when mixed with blood forming nitric oxide that enlarges blood vessels and increases the oxygen content in blood. Consuming beetroot on a regular basis is important to have a healthy heart.

2. Best antioxidant:

Antioxidants are essential to support the immune system. Colourful fruits and vegetables are said to contain antioxidant properties, beetroot being red in colour contains beta cyanine, a very good antioxidant and can reduce LDL, also known as bad cholesterol.

3. The brain factor:

Decline in mental power is very common among aged people. As they get older, they tend to lose memory power. Consuming beetroot is the best solution for this problem. Beetroot when consumed can increase the blood flow to the brain which in turn reduces the effect of dementia.
<div></div>
4. The skeletal health provider:

As beetroots contain natural minerals like silica, it helps the body to utilize the calcium consumed in a proper way providing strength to bones and makes the bones stronger. It also contains nutrients like magnesium, vitamin C, folate that are the best supplements to strengthen bones.

[ Read: <a href=""http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/magnesium-deficiency-why-symptoms-diseases-treatment/"">Deficiency of Magnesium</a> ]

5. Controls the cholesterol:

Adding beetroots to your regular diet can help lowering the cholesterol level. This is because beetroots are rich in soluble fibers that can reduce and control bad cholesterol or LDL.

6. Best nutrients supplier:

Beetroots are rich in nutrients that help to boost your immune system and can produce new blood cells.  A raw beetroot contains folic acid, iron, zinc, magnesium, potassium, fiber, vitamin C and carbohydrates. Folic acid otherwise known as folate is essential during pregnancy as it can prevent spina bifida (lack in the development of spinal cord) in fetus. Folic acid also enhances the tissue growth. Beetroots were also used in earlier days to treat improper digestion. Iron content in beetroot can prevent anaemia.

7. Best energy provider:

Researchers have proven that drinking about 250 ml of beetroot juice before any exercise or physical activity can boost up your performance as beetroot stimulates your blood vessels and is a very good energy provider.

8. Controls blood sugar:

Beetroot can stabilize the glucose level in blood, so when beetroot juice is consumed regularly by diabetic patients at least thrice a week, it can bring a lot of changes in the blood sugar level.
